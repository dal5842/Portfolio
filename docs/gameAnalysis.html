        <h3>Creating the Illusion of a World</h3>
        <p>This project was created during Digit 100. The game fosters an illusion of exploration
            through its straightforward design. Features such as interactive non-player characters,
            including the animated fire and shadow figure, along with quest frameworks and
            environmental elements like directional signs that aid or guide players, enrich this
            experience. Despite the simplicity of the graphics and the minimalistic background
            music, these elements work together to establish a functional, engaging, and
            user-friendly gaming environment.</p>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <h3>Game Settings and Exploration</h3>
        <p>The game environment is designed to be straightforward and practical, initially providing
            few opportunities for exploration. Players learn the game mechanics during a tutorial
            segment, where they engage with items such as a skull and a bone to enhance their
            skills. Notable aspects of the environment consist of interactive signs and objectives,
            including the collection of wood for a non-player character (NPC), which anchors the
            fictional context in recognizable and relatable activities. Although exploration is
            limited, the designated tasks imbue the restricted world with a significant sense of
            purpose.</p>
        <figure>
            <img class="game-analysis-img" src="images/FriendlyFireTutorialPage.png" />
        </figure>
        <h3>Character</h3>
        <p>Players take on the role of a single character, which they choose at the outset of the
            game, with options for either a male or female avatar and the capacity to adjust their
            voice pitch (high or low). This basic level of customization allows for some degree of
            personalization; however, it does not significantly influence the gameplay or narrative
            experience. The character is intentionally crafted to be somewhat generic, aligning with
            the game’s minimalist design philosophy. There is a notable absence of comprehensive
            development concerning the character’s personality or backstory, leading to limited
            emotional investment for players beyond the available customization features. This
            design decision highlights the game’s focus on tasks and challenges rather than on
            narrative intricacy or character depth. While this approach ensures a straightforward
            gaming experience, it ultimately diminishes the uniqueness and memorability of the
            player’s character.</p>

        </figure>
        <h3>Interactions with NPCs</h3>
        <p>Non-playable characters (NPCs) are crucial to advancing the narrative of the game by
            offering quests and support. For example, the animated fire NPC requests that the player
            collect wood to maintain its flames, thereby establishing a task for the player. In
            contrast, the shadow man provides strategic advice. These interactions are
            straightforward and utilitarian, highlighting the game's focus on task completion rather
            than intricate dialogues or the cultivation of deep relationships with NPCs.</p>
        <figure>
            <img class="game-analysis-img" src="images/FriendlyFireFireBlobQuest.png" />
        </figure>
        <h3>Challenges and Progression</h3>
        <p>The game presents players with a range of challenges through the assignment of quests and
            tasks that frequently involve gathering items or engaging in problem-solving activities.
            Environmental cues, such as signs, offer guidance or hints to assist players in their
            pursuits. A notable difficulty arises from the absence of a save function, compelling
            players to adopt strategic approaches and exercise caution, as errors may require a
            total restart of the game. This aspect introduces an additional layer of complexity and
            tension to what is fundamentally a quest-oriented game.</p>

            <img class="game-analysis-img" src="images/FriendlyFireOldTree.png" />
        </figure>
        <h3>Object Interaction</h3>
        <p>In the game, objects are integral to enhancing the gameplay experience. In the initial
            tutorial, players engage with items such as a skull and a bone to grasp the basic
            mechanics. As the game progresses, additional items, including wood required for the
            fire NPC, become vital for quest completion. Moreover, signs dispersed throughout the
            game environment provide written instructions, delivering guidance and contextual
            information to players.</p>
        <figure>
            <img class="game-analysis-img" src="images/FriendlyFireGlove.png" />
        </figure>
        <h3>Sounds and Music</h3>
        <p>The audio design of the game is marked by its straightforwardness and efficiency. The
            background music creates a unified atmosphere that deepens player engagement, even
            though it does not dominate the experience. The sound effects play a more understated
            role, offering minimal hints or critical functions; instead, they contribute to the
            overall ambiance in a refined and supportive manner.</p>
        <figure>
            <img class="game-analysis-img" src="images/FriendlyFireWiseStone.png" />
        </figure>
        <h3>Meta Commentary</h3>
        <p>The game adopts a minimalist aesthetic by incorporating several meta elements, notably a
            straightforward announcement about the lack of a save feature. This self-referential
            aspect prompts players to embrace its simplicity and the challenges that arise from its
            structure. By recognizing this limitation, the game solidifies its unique identity.</p>
        <figure>
            <img class="game-analysis-img" src="images/FriendlyFireEndCredits.png" />
        </figure>
        <h3>Reflection of Reality</h3>
        <p>The game, while situated in a fantastical setting, incorporates aspects that reflect
            genuine human experiences. A significant example is the non-player character (NPC) that
            necessitates wood to sustain its fire, exemplifying essential concepts of survival and
            resource management. Although the game does not extensively explore cultural themes or
            societal critiques, these subtle yet pragmatic connections to real-world logic enhance
            the overall gaming experience.</p>
