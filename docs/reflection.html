        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>When looking at building a website with HTML and a style.css file versus using Penn
            Stateâ€™s WordPress platform, the main differences are in control, simplicity, and
            customization options.</p>
        <h2>Challenges for a new learner</h2>
        <p>New users face many challenges when using GitHub Pages because it needs a good grasp of
            HTML, CSS, and Git, which can be tough for those who haven't used them before. On the
            other hand, WordPress offers an easier learning curve with its simple drag-and-drop
            setup and many ready-made themes, making it a better option for beginners.</p>
        <h2>Advantages of HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>Using HTML and CSS gives full control over the website's look and layout, allowing for
            unique designs. This method requires some coding skills and more time, but it offers
            great flexibility and creative possibilities.</p>
        <h2>Advantages of WordPress</h2>
        <p>On the other hand, WordPress is somewhat easier to use, when it comes to using the
            pre-made themes, drag-and-drop features, and many plugins that make setup quick,
            especially for those without coding knowledge. Customization is possible but often
            limited to the theme chosen, unless custom CSS is added. Though WordPress is much harder
            to navigate depending on what you are looking for. Along with when using some themes
            they will only let you change certain aspects of it. It is also challenging to use when
            it comes to changing the themes on your own page since you have to be in the correct
            location on wordpress when using editing your pages or it will not allow it or work the
            way you want it too.</p>
        <h2>Layout and Modification</h2>
        <p>Changing layouts in GitHub Pages needs direct changes to the code, which can be quite
            complex. On the other hand, WordPress lets you adjust layouts using themes and editing
            tools, but the customization options are somewhat limited.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In summary, HTML and CSS offer deep control and a good learning experience, while
            WordPress focuses on quick and easy content management without needing advanced skills.
            The decision comes down to whether you want more customization or a simpler process. In
            all honesty I would chose html and style css over wordpress any day.</p>
