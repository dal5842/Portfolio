            <h2>Dear Data Project</h2>
            <p>Dear Data is an innovative year-long endeavor by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec,
                two information designers separated by the Atlantic Ocean. Each week, they gathered
                personal data and crafted hand-drawn visualizations on postcards, which they then
                mailed to one another, establishing a distinctive method of "slow data" sharing.
                Every postcard showcased a visual depiction of their weekly experiences, paired with
                a key to aid the recipient in interpreting the artwork. This practice turned data
                collection into a personal narrative, highlighting the importance of human
                connection over mere efficiency. Their goal was to leverage data to cultivate deeper
                relationships rather than just streamline life. Here is my version, I decided to
                track my phone app catagories useage for a week.</p>

        <h2>The Lion Shrine Scan on Scaniverse with ThingLink</h2>
        <p>Here's a ThingLink scan that was created for DIGIT 100. Scaniverse is a free app that
            lets you capture, edit, and share 3D models of objects, rooms, buildings, and outdoor
            environments using your phone which is then is plugged into thinglink which is a web app
            and app that lets users create interactive content by adding tags to images, videos, and
            360-degree media. Then annotations are added and those are notes of explanation or
            comment added to a text or diagram. <iframe class="thingLink" width="640" height="360"
