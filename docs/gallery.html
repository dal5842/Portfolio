            <h2>Dear Data Project From Digit 100</h2>
            <p>Dear Data is an innovative year-long endeavor by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec,
                two information designers separated by the Atlantic Ocean. Each week, they gathered
                personal data and crafted hand-drawn visualizations on postcards, which they then
                mailed to one another, establishing a distinctive method of "slow data" sharing.
                Every postcard showcased a visual depiction of their weekly experiences, paired with
                a key to aid the recipient in interpreting the artwork. This practice turned data
                collection into a personal narrative, highlighting the importance of human
                connection over mere efficiency. Their goal was to leverage data to cultivate deeper
                relationships rather than just streamline life. Here is my version, I decided to
                track my phone app catagories useage for a week.</p>

        <h2>Art 168 Projects</h2>
        <p>Class description : The Digital Medium course is an introductory studio class that
            explores the computer as an artistic medium, rather than just a tool. It focuses on
            creating art around specific themes and concepts, with each lesson building on the last.
            The course covers a wide range of digital media, encouraging flexibility and
            interdisciplinary collaboration. By the end, students will have an intermediate
            understanding of digital art, demonstrated through their final portfolio. Here is a list
            of all of my simple projects that I created with the knowledge I learned from the
            course: </p>

            <p>My boyfriend and his two old square body chevy trucks. The black truck is a 1976 K5
                chevy blazer, and the green truck is a 1979 K10 chevy cheyenne. My goal was to bring
                out the colors more in both the trucks and the sunset. Along with to have the
                ablility to see Gavin more between the trucks. I also wanted to sharpen the look of
                the trucks to show the true square body truck.</p>

            <p>Gavin is a taxiderist who is big into anything outdoorsy so he does trapping. Last
                year he got this 50 pound beaver during beaver trapping season. Though with the
                photo after I looked at it later I noticed how dark it was and that you really could
                not see the beavers fur colors. So I went through to try and edit to brighten up the
                overall picture and be able to see the fur of the beaver though wet but see its
                other fur colors that you would see dry.</p>
