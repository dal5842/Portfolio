        <p>This project explores patterns of word usage in different texts using tools like Voyant
            and AntConc. By analyzing word frequency, ngrams, and keywords in context (KWIC), we
            uncover linguistic patterns and compare texts from various genres or periods.
            Visualizations and data highlight key differences or similarities, offering insights
            into how language is used across the texts. I have chosen to compare multiple song
            lyrics from multiple alternative/rock bands. I choose to compare two songs each from
            these five bands, Foo Fighters, Green Day, Linkin Park (old and new), Red Hot Chili
            Peppers and Metalica. In all the images on the left you can see a big jumble of fifty
            words. As seen some of the words are larger than others which means that the larger then
            word the more frequent it is used through the song. The right set of images below hold a
            list of text of KWIC. Which shows what songs lyrics it is under file, along with the
            context it is in, the keyword/most frequent more is and the highlighted the keyword used
            in the context.</p>
