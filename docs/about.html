        <h2>Here's a little about me!</h2>
        <p>Hi all! My name is Dannika Love and I am a second-year DIGIT student at Penn State
            Behrend! I am the daughter of Jodie and Ron Love, I have an older sister, Kalie, along
            with a brother-in-law, Dan. I enjoy being creative whether it be painting, a craft or
            anything artistic. I enjoy to cook and bake, along with just having time to relax on my
            phone. I am a really big family person, I love my family so much, I currently live two
            hours from home to go to college and it is not the easiest thing to do. I enjoy hanging
            out with my family and my high sweetheart boyfriend, Gavin, along with his family. I
            love going to see my grandma, who is an absolute hoot. This is just a little about me. </p>
