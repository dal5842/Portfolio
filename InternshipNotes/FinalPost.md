Hours completed this week: 11 hours
Total hours logged this semester far : 127 hours 30 minutes

I have learned many things from the internship this semester at the Erie Art Museum.
This fall, I completed a little over 127 hours as a Digital Collections Intern at the Erie Art Museum. This role gave me hands-on experience in digitization, organizing data, ensuring accessibility, and evaluating digital tools that support cultural preservation. Here is a short summary of my projects and the lessons I learned during this experience.
Working Behind the Scenes of a Museum’s Digital Collection

A lot of work goes into getting artworks ready for digital platforms like Google Arts & Culture. Throughout the semester, I helped by:
	• Taking photographs of artworks and carefully handling the physical pieces
	• Adding missing descriptions, dates, and artist information
	• Creating alt text to improve image accessibility
	• Improving metadata and fixing wrongly labeled entries
	• Moving non-collection items from Google Docs into a well-organized Google Sheet
	• Setting up a color-coding system for duplicates and organizing files for easy access
	
This experience was my first introduction to the significance of accuracy and consistency in documenting a collection. Every detail is vital for maintaining the story of the artwork.
Exploring Software, Systems, and OCR Tools

A major part of my internship focused on researching and comparing:
	• Collections management systems (like CollectiveAccess and Artwork Archive)
	• Digital asset management tools
	• OCR software that converts scanned documents into searchable text

I looked into initial setup costs, subscription fees, upgrade cycles, and how sustainable each option is over time. I also performed OCR tests on sample documents to evaluate how well each tool recognized text.

This project gave me a better understanding of how museums choose technologies—not just based on features, but also taking into account budget limits, long-term maintenance needs, and how well the software fits with current workflows.
Applying DIGIT Skills in a Real Museum Environment

My experience in the DIGIT program was directly relevant to my work:
	• Organizing metadata was similar to handling XML and schemas.
	• Creating alt text followed the same accessibility guidelines we use in web design.
	• Data cleaning mirrored the organization and transformation tasks we perform with markup and spreadsheets.
	• Assessing software required the research and UX factors we study in class.

Seeing how classroom skills translate to real museum problems was one of the most rewarding parts of the internship.

Lessons Learned from the Experience

My time at the museum showed that:
	• Quality metadata is essential—small errors can cause major problems later.
	• Accessibility should be part of the process from the beginning, not an afterthought.
	• Museums rely heavily on sustainable, well-organized digital systems.
	• Good communication and detailed documentation make collaborative digital projects run more smoothly.

In conclusion, this internship has strengthened my enthusiasm for digital preservation, cultural technology, and accessible design.

Final Thoughts

My time at the Erie Art Museum has helped me grow as a digital creator and researcher. I learned how digital collections are built, how data supports preservation efforts, and how thoughtful design improves the accessibility of cultural resources for everyone. I am eager to use these skills in future DIGIT projects and in the next stages of my academic and professional journey.
